# Project Valhalla

*Valhalla* â€“ In Norse mythology, Valhalla, the hall of the slain warriors, was, symbolically,
unbreachable. An invincible fortress, protected by Odin himself, where only the worthy made it
inside. Heimdall kept an eye on all, and all warriors within would wait until judgement day, 
or Ragnarok, when they would go defend the allfather. Essentially, valhalla would only
be destroyed, and emptied, when Ragnarok came.

This is the less poetic, more useful version. Valhalla is a Python project designed to 
interact with a local MySQL database. It uses a master password, which is stored as a 
hash, to encrypt and decrypt passwords from a given table. 

SHA-256 is utilized as the Hashing algorithm and 
aes is utilized as the encryption standard of choice.

## Features
- Interacts with local MySQL database
- Stores the master password as a hash (secure)
- Encrypts and decrypts passwords from MySQL table

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Update secrets.yaml file with your own personal configuration

*Recommended:* run following command to make sure your secrets are protected
    ```sh
    git update-index --assume-unchanged src/valhalla/config/secrets.yaml
    ```
    to undo this action (for any reason)
    ```sh
    git update-index --no-assume-unchanged src/valhalla/config/secrets.yaml
    ```

### Installing MySql
I recommend following the instructions on the official MySQL website to install MySQL on your machine.
[MySQL Installation Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/)

If you will be using wsl, here is a quick guide to use mysql in your windows machine from wsl: https://dev.to/qviper/connecting-mysql-server-in-windows-machine-from-wsl-4pf1

To find the host, localhost may not suffice. Try running the below command to find the equivalent to localhost on wsl:
```sh
ip route show | grep -i default | awk '{ print $3}'
```

## Usage
1. Set up your MySQL database and configure the connection settings.
2. Run the main script to start interacting with the database:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py
    ```

## Testing
Run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
```sh
python3 -m unittest discover tst
```

## Additional Features/Comments
- convert_to_unix.sh is a simple shell script that will
    recursively turn all files into unix typing. If this is not desired, 
    then simply change dos2unix into unix2dos and run script.
